\usage{

}
\description{
A simulated dataset containing clinical, demographic, and CACS data
for demonstrating the BioHEART resilience analysis methodology.
}
\details{
This simulated dataset mimics the structure and distributions found in
real cardiovascular cohort studies. The data includes:

\itemize{
\item Realistic age and gender distributions
\item Cardiovascular risk factors with appropriate correlations
\item CACS values that follow zero-inflated distributions
\item Missing data patterns similar to real clinical studies
\item Medication use patterns reflecting clinical practice
}

The dataset is designed to demonstrate all features of the resilience
analysis pipeline including handling of missing data, multiple risk score
calculations, and classification of resilience phenotypes.
